seizure-detection-boost
=======================

The notebook [postprocessing.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/udibr/seizure-detection-boost/blob/master/postprocessing.ipynb) take a submission to the kaggle
competition:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-prediction

and produce a new submission which hopefully has a higher public leader board score. Does not always work...

also the notebook may have bugs since I copied paste working notebooks I have.
Please send pull requests and I will fix it
